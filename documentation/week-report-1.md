## Week report 1

This week I decided on what I should do and look a bit into the algorithms
I should use. I also started to write the definition document. I still
haven't figured out how to start to implement the algorithm other than
defining edges of carcassonne tiles and run that through the wave collapse algorithm

I used about 5 hours to figure out what to do but ultimately decided to
do a different project than I originally thought of
