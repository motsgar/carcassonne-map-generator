## Week report 4

This week I didn't do that much code but I figured out what the final project
scope should be. I did some research on simple mazze generation algorighms and
have decided on what I will use to have a sparse maze.

As a kind of micellaneous thing I also dockerized the project and set up a
simple CI pipeline that builds the docker container and set up a website where
the project is available.

This week I spent maybe total 10 hours on the project where about 6 hours of that
was to set up the server and the CI pipeline. The second half was spent on
figuring out what I need to do to have a big enough scope for the project and
trying to find a sparse maze generation algorithm.

Next week I will implement the maze generation algorithm I found and integrate
it into the map generation algorithm. I will also restructure the project to
allow for testing as I haven't yet got a project structure that is testable.
