TODO

Tests test all logic code but not UI code.

Tests haven't yet been written as the project structure is still a bit of a mess because I haven't yet figured out
a way to have the algorithm code testable but for the algorithm code to be able to communicate with the UI code.

To test the project run `npm run test`
