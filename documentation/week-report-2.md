## Week report 2

This week I set up a basic project structure and development environment
with typescript, eslint and jest. I have started researching how to
implement the wave function collapse algorithm and thought about what
the UI should look like.

In the next week I will continue researching and thinking on how to
efficiently implement the wave function collapse algorithm and start
implementing it but I will start by first implementing a basic UI for
visualizing generated worlds. I will also look into getting coverage
reports from jest shown on the github page.
