## Week report 6

This week I actually started doing UI stuff by creating a import function for
tilemap json data, but didn't continue to doing rendering. Instead I implemented
the backracking for cell collapsing. Also I didn't start working with tests
because when I thought about doing tests, I always started rather doing something
more "productive" like implementing the actual backtracking algorithm. I will
try to do test stuff on sunday.

This week I managed to spend a bit more time with the project than last week.
I spent maybe a total of 10 hours. I would have liked to have spent more time
on the start of the week and yesterday. I probably should have already started
writing the implementation document, but that will also be done on sunday.

I will now try to start by writing tests for the current code and then continue
with the UI. Also I'll have to draw some very simple images for tiles. This is
also kind of part of the UI, but I'll have to also finnish writing event callbacks
for the algorithm functions. Also I will implement a way of slowing the algorithm
down for the sake of UI visualization. I'll try to get the UI finnished by the
end of the week.
